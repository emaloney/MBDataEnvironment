/*!
 Instances of the `MBEnvironmentLoader` class are used to parse MBML tags when
 loading an `MBEnvironment`.
 
 For example, the `MBVariableSpace` class is an `MBEnvironmentLoader`, because
 `MBVariableSpace` is capable of populating itself with variables based on the
 contents of an MBML file.
 
 Functionality can also be added to the Mockingbird Data Environment 
 through the use of `MBModule`s. A module implementation has the option of
 providing additional `MBEnvironmentLoader`s to use during the environment
 loading process. This allows new MBML tags to be introduced without
 needing to modify the code of the Mockingbird Data Environment itself.
 See the documentation for the `MBEnvironment` class for more information
 on extending the Mockingbird Data Environment using modules.
